"""Canonical provider -> API-key env-var mapping.

A single source of truth for which environment variable holds the API
key for each supported LLM provider. Used by the CLI's interactive key
prompt (cli/utils.ensure_api_key) and by anything else that needs to
ask "does this provider require a key, and which env var is it?".

When adding a new provider, register its env var here so the CLI flow
prompts for it automatically instead of failing on first API call.
